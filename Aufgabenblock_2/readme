Second part of CS Lab 2 which adds an abstract base class(Simulation object) and another class called Weg(Road).
Fahrzeug(Vehicle) and Weg(Road) are both derived classes from Simulation object, PKW(Personal Car) and Fahhrad(Bike) are both derived classes from Fahrzeug(Vehicle).

I also added a class called Verhalten(Behavior) which and two child-classes Fahren(Driving) and Parken(parked).
The class Fahrzeug(Vehile) has a member variable which is a pointer to Verhalten(Behavior) which determine whether the vehicle is parked or driving. 
This is an example of State-Behavioral pattern.


To manage exceptions, I've added an Exception class called Fahrausnahme with two sub-classes Streckenende(RoadEnd) and Losfahren(BeginDrive).
